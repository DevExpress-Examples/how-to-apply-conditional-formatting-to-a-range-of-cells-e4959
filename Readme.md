# How to apply conditional formatting to a range of cells


<p>This example illustrates how to get started with conditional formatting that can be applied to cells that match a certain condition specified by a conditional formatting rule.</p>
<p>In particular, this sample demonstrates how to use the Spreadsheet Document API to create the following types of conditional formatting rules:</p>
<p>- a rule that formats cells whose values are above or below the average;</p>
<p>- a rule that highlights cells whose values are between or not between two specified values;</p>
<p>- a rule that formats top or bottom ranked values;</p>
<p>- a rule that highlights cells containing the given text;</p>
<p>- a rule that formats unique or duplicate values, blank cells and formula errors;</p>
<p>- a rule that highlights cells containing dates in the specified time period;</p>
<p>- a rule that formats cells whose values meet the condition expressed by the relational operator;</p>
<p>- a rule that uses a formula to determine which cells to format;</p>
<p>- a two-color scale conditional formatting rule;</p>
<p>- a three-color scale conditional formatting rule;</p>
<p>- a data bar conditional formatting rule;</p>
<p>- an icon set conditional formatting rule.<br><br>The<strong> Universal Subscription</strong> or an additional <strong>Office File API Subscription</strong> is required to use this example in production code.
